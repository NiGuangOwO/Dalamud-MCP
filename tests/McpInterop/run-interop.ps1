# Interop checks: the protocol framing, judged by somebody else's implementation
#
# Every other suite in tests\ speaks JSON-RPC that this repo's author wrote by hand. If a framing
# detail were misread - the wrong session header, an initialize result shape only this project
# emits, a tool result an agent cannot parse - those hand-written tests would agree with the
# server's own mistake and still pass. This suite removes that blind spot by driving the real
# server with the OFFICIAL @modelcontextprotocol/sdk.
#
# What it does NOT cover: the Dalamud-facing half of the plugin. It only exercises
# src\DalamudMCP\Mcp\*.cs (the transport and protocol), hosted in-process by tests\McpInterop\host.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -File tests\McpInterop\run-interop.ps1
#
# Exit code 0 means every interop check and the negative control passed.
